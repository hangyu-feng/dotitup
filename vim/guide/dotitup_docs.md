### tpope/vim-abolish
Just read the docs for this one:
https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish
###

### tpope/vim-surround
Adds the ability to change surrounding quotes/tags.

For example `'something'` and change to `"something"`
with the cursor over the word: `cs'"`
Which says: change surrounding single quotes to double quotes.

It works for tags as well, so for `"something"`,
`cs"<b>` will change it to `<b>something</b>`.
And then to change that to `'something'`, do `cst'`
Which says: change surrounding tag to single quotes.

You can also add surrounding characters to text objects 
that have none. So for `something`, `ysaw'`
Which says: add surrounding around word to single quotes.
That's not proper English but you get the gist.

See vim-surround readme for more.

### tpope/vim-unimpaired

using `[` for previous and `]` for next

| Instruction   | Description                                                   |
| ---           | ---                                                           |
| `[q` and `]q` | for `:cnext` and `:cprev` (navigating quickfix)               |
| `[b` and `]b` | for `:bnext` and `:bprev` (navigating buffers)                |
| `[f` and `]f` | for prev/next file in directory (navigating files)            |
| `[f` and `]f` | for prev/next file in directory (navigating files)            |

### terryma/vim-multiple-cursors
Adds multiple cursor editing support
Use `<C-n>` to highlight the word under the cursor
Repeat `<C-n>` to select the next instances of the word
Then you can use normal editing comments, like `c` to change
all the selected words together.

There are ways to use with visual selections as well, see docs.
###

### bogado/file-line
Allows the ability to enter a file exactly at it's line.
e.g. on the command line if you started vim like:
`vim part/to/file.rb:35`
it will take you to line 35 of file.rb
Can also be used with opening files normally in vim:
`:e part/to/file.rb:35`
Would also take you to like 35 of file.rb

This is great for copy pasting file + line number from 
error outputs and going directly to the source instead
of additionally finding the line after opening the file.

### junegunn/vim-easy-align
Allows for easy alignment of text

From:
```ruby
{
  hello: "there",
  foo: "bar",
  name: "Jameel"
}
```

To:
```ruby
{
  hello: "there",
  foo:   "bar",
  name:  "Jameel"
}
```

In this case, highlight the related lines and press `ga:`
`ga` activates the easy-align plugin, and 
then `:` tells it to align on the `:` character.

Probably best to visit https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align for full usage.

### FZF Helpers
The FZF commands are prefixed with `Fzf`
So if you don't find the commands from the FZF docs
by running them, that is why.

Look at the FZF docs for usage.
